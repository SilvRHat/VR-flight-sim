This is the default directory for local data saving on Prepar3D testbed application

## Configuration
Under TOME_Testbed/CONFIG.lua, a variety of settings can be set on how data is saved.
- Filenames - The names of data files can be changed. There is also an optional to prepend a string to file names for organization on multiple test runs and different machines.
- Simulation Variables - A list of prepar3D simulation variables can be specified (ground velocity, acceleration, etc.), which are stored every x seconds.
    - Full list of variables available at: https://www.prepar3d.com/SDKv5/sdk/references/variables/variables_overview.html
